# Iris Flower Classification Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to classify Iris flower species based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset used for this project is the famous Iris dataset. The goal is to build and evaluate machine learning models to accurately predict the species of an Iris flower given its measurements.

## Motivation

Inspired by my admiration for a person who makes everything sweet and easy, this project is dedicated to her. She is like the Iris flower—cute, beautiful, kind, honest, and adorable. I Love You, Lamis!

## Collaborators

This project was developed in collaboration with LamisAbdullah.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which contains 150 observations of iris flowers. Each observation includes the following features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Species (target variable)

The dataset can be found in the file `IRIS.csv`.

## Installation

To run the code, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- scikit-learn (version 1.5.0)
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install scikit-learn==1.5.0 pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```
## Results

The project applies three machine learning models—Logistic Regression, K-nearest Neighbors, and Decision Tree—to classify Iris species. The accuracy of each model is printed after training and evaluating on the test data.

## Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by and dedicated to LamisAbdullah, who has been a source of joy and inspiration.
